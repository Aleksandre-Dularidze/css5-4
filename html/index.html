            Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales,
            this hostel has a rich history tied to mountaineering and the great
            outdoors. Originally built as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it
            served travelers journeying through the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
            What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over
            the decades, it became a base for legendary climbers who tackled the
            Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of ridges—and contributed to
            the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.

            Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885,
            the HI Sacramento Hostel offers a glimpse into the grandeur of
            California's past. Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector,
            the mansion later became a boarding house and eventually a hostel.
            Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows,
            carved wooden staircases, and period furnishings, makes it a unique
            blend of history and hospitality.

            Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped in history. Built in the 19th century, the building was where Charles Dickens worked as a court reporter, inspiring elements of his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a magistrates' court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash. Today, the hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can stay in refurbished prison cells and relax in the courtroom-turned-lounge.
